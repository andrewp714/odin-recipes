    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A ham and cheese sandwich is a classic, satisfying meal that’s quick to prepare and endlessly customizable. At its simplest,
      it consists of slices of savory ham and creamy cheese layered between two pieces of bread. You can enjoy it cold for a quick
      lunch or grill it to golden perfection for a warm, melty treat. Common additions like mustard, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato,
      or pickles can add extra flavor and texture.
    </p>
    <p>This sandwich is perfect for busy days or casual meals and can be made with whatever bread and cheese you have on hand—white,
      whole wheat, sourdough, cheddar, Swiss, or even a croissant. Whether served fresh or toasted, a ham and cheese sandwich delivers
      a balanced bite of salty, creamy, and crisp goodness in every mouthful.
