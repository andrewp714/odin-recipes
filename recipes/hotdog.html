    <!-- Recipe Description -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hot dog is a classic, crowd-pleasing dish made by placing a cooked sausage—typically beef, pork, or chicken—into a
       soft bun and topping it with condiments like ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, or sauerkraut. Quick to prepare and easy
       to customize, hot dogs can be boiled, grilled, or pan-fried, making them perfect for everything from casual weeknight
       dinners to backyard cookouts. Whether kept simple or loaded with toppings, hot dogs are a versatile comfort food enjoyed by
       people of all ages.
