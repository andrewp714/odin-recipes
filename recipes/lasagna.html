    <p>Lasagna is a classic baked Italian pasta dish consisting of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets with various fillings. The most common American versions feature a hearty tomato and meat sauce,
        a rich and creamy mixture of ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella on top. Regional Italian variations may instead use a thick béchamel sauce or fillings like pesto, vegetables, or savory minced meats.
        After being assembled in a casserole dish, the lasagna is baked until the cheese is golden and bubbling. </p>
    <p>A slice of lasagna reveals its delicious cross-section of flavor, with each layer holding its own
        distinct purpose. The starchy pasta sheets create the structure, the sauce and meat provide a rich and savory depth, and the cheeses add creaminess and a decadent pull. The crispy, browned edges and top layer
        of melted cheese contrast with the softer, tender layers beneath. This hearty, comforting casserole has a rich and storied history, with each family and region adding their own unique twist.</p>
